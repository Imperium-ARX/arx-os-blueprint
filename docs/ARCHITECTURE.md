# How the OS works

This is the under-the-hood explainer. You don't need it to use the system; it exists for the moment you ask "wait, how does it actually do that?" Prefer pictures? Open [system-map.html](system-map.html) in your browser for the visual version.

## The big picture

The OS is a folder of plain text files plus Claude Code. On day one there is no database to stand up, no server to keep alive, no app to maintain: Claude reads instructions from the folder, acts through its tools (file edits, terminal commands, web access, connected services), and writes what it learns back into the folder. Because everything is text in one place, you can read any of it, version all of it, and move it anywhere. (A database and a server DO ship in the box - the dormant operating layer, section 6 - but they stay inert until you choose to activate them.)

Four ideas make it an operating system rather than a chatbot: a layered instruction system, a memory system, a skill library, and a self-improvement loop. The onboarding measures all four through one model, the Four C's, covered at the end.

## 1. The three-tier instruction layer

Claude's behaviour is shaped by instructions loaded at three depths:

**Tier 1: always-on.** `.claude/CLAUDE.md` plus the rules in `.claude/rules/`. Loaded at the start of every session, no exceptions. This is where the non-negotiables live: persist knowledge immediately, check for a skill before doing work manually, run the quality gate on deliverables, never write AI-sounding prose, never reveal items on the owner's privacy list, stress-test ideas instead of agreeing by default. Always-on space is expensive (it's read every session), so only rules that apply broadly earn a place here.

**Tier 2: on-demand rules.** `.claude/rules-import/` holds detailed rules that only matter in specific situations: how to format documents, how media storage works, how to handle large files. Tier 1 contains one-line pointers; the full rule is read only when the situation comes up. This keeps every session fast without losing depth.

**Tier 3: skills.** `.claude/skills/` holds the workflow library. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` with a frontmatter `description` and a stepwise body (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`). Skills load only when triggered, which is why the OS can hold dozens of workflows without slowing anything down.

The tiers exist to manage one scarce resource: Claude's attention. Broad rules always loaded, deep rules loaded when relevant, workflows loaded when invoked.

**Engine vs seed files.** Every path in the box belongs to one of two classes, and the split is the contract any updater (including the desktop app) must honour:

- **Engine** - the product. Replaced wholesale by updates, never personalized: `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/rules-import/`, `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/reference/`, `scripts/`, `dashboard/`, `brain/`, `automations/`, and the system docs in `docs/`.
- **Seed** - this install. Written by onboarding and daily use, never touched by updates: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `context/`, `memory/`, `Home.md`, `content-pipeline/`, `outputs/`, `data/`, `packs/installed.json` (and everything an update doesn't explicitly own, e.g. `clients/` and `.env`). One exception inside `context/`: `context/README.md` (the source-of-truth map) is engine-authored structure whose rulings are edited in place by the install - updaters merge, never clobber.

The always-on instruction layer straddles the line by design: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` is the seed shell (identity and context imports, the memory-targets table, `<!-- ENGINE-BOUNDARY -->` markers documenting the split), while the stable half - hard rules, development rules, key paths - lives in the engine-class rule `.claude/rules/00-engine-core.md`. An update can ship better hard rules without ever touching who the system works for.

Three engine paths accumulate seed-written content and are **merge points, not replace points**, for any updater: `.claude/rules/13-owner-privacy.md` (onboarding writes the privacy list into it), `.claude/reference/skills-routing-index.md` (rows appended per built skill and installed pack), and `.claude/skills/` (installed pack skills are copied in; `packs/installed.json` records exactly which). An updater that clobbers these loses user data - preserve the recorded deltas.

**Base vs department packs.** The live skill library starts as the ~21 engine skills every seat needs: memory, routing, quality control, research, client delivery. Department-specific workflows (content production, finance, ops, sales) ship as optional packs in `packs/` - each a bundle of skills, memory scaffolds, and templates with a manifest describing exactly what it adds. `node scripts/install-pack.js <pack>` copies a pack's skills into the live library, wires their routing, and records the install in `packs/installed.json`; uninstall reverses every byte of it. The point is per-seat leanness: a finance seat never carries YouTube packaging skills, and the routing index only ever lists workflows that can actually run. The pack spec lives at `packs/README.md`.

## 2. The memory system

The core discipline: **anything the owner says gets written to the right file immediately.** Not summarized at the end of a chat, not held in the model's head. Written, now, to a known location.

| You mention... | It lands in... |
|---|---|
| A person, contact, or relationship | `memory/people.md` |
| A goal, decision, or commitment | `memory/kanban.md` (commitments live on the board) |
| A task or deadline | `memory/kanban.md` + `memory/calendar.md` |
| Money in or out | `memory/finances.md` |
| A content idea | `memory/content/ideas_backlog.md` |
| A lesson or behaviour pattern | `memory/patterns.md` |
| A system change | `memory/system_changelog.md` |

Alongside memory sits `context/`: the short, stable truth about the company (what it is, what it sells, to whom, in what words). Context is read at the start of every session; memory is searched when needed. Context stays lean by design: pointers and one-pagers, not archives.

**Org truth vs seat truth.** Context splits in two. `context/org/` holds company-wide facts (company, offers, glossary, departments, people roster) - identical for every seat. `context/seat.md` holds this install's facts: who sits here, who actually operates the chat day to day, what this seat approves vs escalates, its KPIs. A single-seat install fills both locally during onboarding. A multi-seat company treats `context/org/` as read-only: the install team pre-loads it identically on every seat (and rolls out accepted changes), and seats propose corrections upward through `memory/org-proposals/` instead of editing - so five department heads never hold five drifting versions of the company. Team contributions flow separately and automatically into the read-only `context/team/`, synced from the company workspace built into Imperium OS.

The payoff is continuity. Session 50 knows everything session 1 learned, because nothing important ever lived only in a chat window.

## 3. Skills and auto-triggering

A skill's frontmatter `description` doubles as its trigger definition: it states what the skill does and the phrases that should invoke it. Claude scans descriptions when you ask for something; a match means the skill runs instead of an improvised one-off. Say "what's on this week?" and the kanban workflow runs; ask for a client update email and the drafting skill loads your voice guide first.

This is the difference between a tool and an operating system: the same request gets the same proven workflow every time, and improving the skill file improves every future run.

Skills are also how the OS grows. Phase 5 of onboarding builds your first 3-5 from your actual weekly tasks, and any repeated request after that is a candidate: "make this a skill" turns today's one-off into tomorrow's standard.

## 4. Hooks: deterministic guardrails

Rules instruct; hooks enforce. A hook (`.claude/hooks/`) is a small script that the harness runs automatically at fixed moments, outside Claude's discretion:

- **In the background:** Imperium OS keeps the seat's knowledge folders saved to the company workspace and pulls new team contributions into `context/team/`, so every session opens on current shared knowledge.
- **On every prompt you send:** a parser helps route long, multi-topic brain dumps so nothing in them gets dropped.
- **Before risky tool use:** protected files can't be edited or deleted; YouTube work is forced through the proper transcript tool instead of unreliable scraping.
- **After every response:** an anti-sycophancy check blocks the failure mode where the assistant reverses a recommendation just because you pushed back without new evidence. Recommendations must state what evidence would change them.
- **Also after every response:** a report-only nudger spots capture opportunities - a heavy multi-step run that never became a skill, or a brain dump that never landed in memory - and suggests the capture (one nudge per session, never auto-writes anything).

One more always-on file rides with the instruction layer: `context/identity.md`, the system's persona - its name, how it addresses you, its register, and what it always pushes back on - kept under 150 words because it loads every session.

The distinction matters: an instruction can in principle be missed on a bad day; a hook cannot. Anything that must never silently fail lives in a hook.

## 5. The self-improvement loop

Two scripts keep the OS healthy as it grows:

- **`scripts/generate-registry.js`** builds a machine-readable index of every skill and rule: name, triggers, file path, last update. The registry is how the system stays aware of its own capabilities, and how "is there already a skill for this?" gets answered accurately.
- **`scripts/os-lint.js`** checks the whole system for drift: skills referencing files that no longer exist, missing frontmatter, rules pointing at dead paths, stale registry entries. Run weekly, or whenever things feel off.

The loop is: **use the system → notice friction → change a skill or rule → re-run registry + lint → review the diff → commit.** The human review gate is deliberate. The OS proposes its own improvements and fixes mechanical problems, but a person approves changes to how it behaves. Because everything is text under version control, every change is visible and reversible.

This is why the system gets better with use instead of decaying: corrections become rule edits, repeated requests become skills, and the lint catches rot before you feel it.

## 6. The operating layer (dormant modules)

Everything above runs on files alone. Alongside it, the box ships an operating layer for the moment the company wants live operational data - present, documented, runnable on sample data with zero credentials, and activated later with the build team. Three pieces, one contract:

- **The Brain (`brain/`).** A Postgres schema (Supabase) for structured operational data: knowledge documents, an approval queue, an append-only audit log, the daily brief, team activity. Only that universal core ships; the tables for what YOUR company operates on (orders, projects, shipments) are designed at activation as domain extensions following the same conventions. Table names are a contract with every consumer - nothing renames alone.
- **The worker (`automations/worker/`).** A small Node service: connectors pull data in, ONE event router (hub-and-spoke - agents are stateless and never call each other) processes it, and a `/api/*` layer serves the results. It boots today with zero keys, serving fixtures mirrored from the Brain's seed, and labels every response `"source": "fixtures"` so sample data can never pass as live.
- **The cockpit contract (`dashboard/README.md`).** Not an app - a spec any dashboard must satisfy: one typed data-source adapter (`DATA_SOURCE=mock|sheets|supabase`), mock data derived only from the seed, a visible "SEED DATA" badge on every non-live surface, and fallback-to-mock instead of blank screens.

**Why ship it dormant instead of leaving it out?** One clone carries everything - no "phase 2 repo" to bolt on later, no version skew between the OS a company started with and the operating layer it activates a quarter in. The contract (table names, endpoint shapes, seed rows) is exercised by the fixtures from day one, so activation changes configuration, not architecture. And safety is by construction rather than by promise: the database ships default-deny (row security forced, zero public policies), the audit log physically rejects edits, and actions touching money, legal, or external comms park in the approval queue for a human - those properties hold before the first credential exists.

## The Four C's

The model behind onboarding and the weekly health check. Each scored out of 10:

- **Context.** Does the system know the business? (Identity, company one-pager, offers, glossary, voice profile, privacy list.)
- **Connections.** Is it plugged into where the work happens? (Email and calendar, research tools, notifications, optional extras - backup is built in.)
- **Capabilities.** Can it do the work? (Skills built, each proven on at least one real run.)
- **Cadence.** Does work happen on rhythm? (What runs scheduled vs on-demand, the task board, the weekly health re-check.)

Onboarding walks the four in order: Phases 1-3 build Context, Phase 4 builds Connections, Phase 5 builds Capabilities, Phase 6 sets Cadence, and Phase 7 records the baseline scores. Day-one scores are low on purpose; the weekly re-check is where you watch them climb, and a C that stalls tells you exactly where to invest next.

## What keeps it safe

- **Local first.** The folder lives on your machine. The only things that leave it are requests to services you connected yourself.
- **Secrets stay out of backups.** Keys live in `.env`, which is excluded from version control by default.
- **Human-in-the-loop on irreversible actions.** Nothing is sent, posted, or invoiced without sign-off, per the guardrails you set in onboarding.
- **Everything is reversible.** Text + git means any change, by you or the system, can be inspected and rolled back.
